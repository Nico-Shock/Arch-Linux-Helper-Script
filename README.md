# Perfect Helper Script for Post Setup After an Arch Installation

## **What the Script Does**

- **The script will automatically install the CachyOS repos to make your system more stable and make many things easier to install from the repo. Everything will be automated so you donâ€™t need to edit anything.**
- **Then, the script will install the Chaotic AUR repos (for the same bad explained reason as the CachyOS repos).**
- **Next, the script will install the CachyOS Kernel Manager for you.**
- **Then, the script will install the CachyOS Gaming Meta to... game on it.**
- **Install CachyOS Open NVIDIA Drivers.**
- **Installs lots of recommended software (the script will show you the installed packages).**

### *The script asks you about every step you're running before it gets executed. Future updates will be made to improve the experience.*
