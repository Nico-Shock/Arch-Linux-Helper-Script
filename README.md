# Perfect Helper Script for Post Setup After an Arch Installation

## **What the Script Does**

- **The script will automatically install the CachyOS repos to make your system more stable and make many things easier to install from the repo. Everything will be automated so you donâ€™t need to edit anything.**
- **Then, the script will install the Chaotic AUR repos (for the same bad explained reason as the CachyOS repos).**
- **Next, the script will install the CachyOS Kernel Manager for you.**
- **Then, the script will install the CachyOS Gaming Meta to... game on it.**
- **Installs the CachyOS open Nvidia drivers or the closed nvidia-dkms drivers.**
- **Installs lots of recommended software (the script will show you the installed packages).**

### *The script asks you about every step you're running before it gets executed. Future updates will be made to improve the experience.*

**How to run the script:**

- Go into the directory of the file, for example, for Downloads: `cd Downloads/`
- Then make the file executable: `chmod +x Helper.sh`
- Then execute it: `./Helper.sh`

*Sorry btw that I "spam" the releases every time when I write a new script. I need to get used to it, but after like 3-4 releases, it will get better and I won't spam the releases that much.*

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you get a question about adding the "Garuda Build" key, press **no** because while system upgrade it will fail completely and you need to manually install the CachyOS repos again.
