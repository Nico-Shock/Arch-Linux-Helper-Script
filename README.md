# Perfect Helper Script for Post Setup After an Arch Installation

### **You can run this command to execute the latest script directly:**
```
bash <(curl -L https://github.com/Nico-Shock/Arch-Linux-Helper-Script/releases/latest/download/Helper.sh)
```

## **What the Script Does**

- **The script will automatically install the CachyOS repos.**
- **Then, the script will install the Chaotic AUR repos.**
- **Next, the script will install the CachyOS Kernel Manager for you.**
- **Then, the script will install the CachyOS Gaming Meta to... game on it.**
- **Installs the CachyOS open Nvidia drivers or the closed nvidia-dkms drivers.**
- **Installs the AMD or Intel GPU drivers.**
- **Installs lots of recommended software (the script will show you the installed packages).**
- **Installs a better kernel for you.**
- **Deletes temporary files and cleans up your system.**
- **Automatically updates your system.**
- **Remove bloatware from your Gnome Desktop (just uninstall Gnome apps considered "bloatware"). It will not remove any other package than "gnome" packages.**

### *The script asks you about every step you're running before it gets executed. Future updates will be made to improve the experience.*

**How to run the script:**

- Go into the directory of the file, for example, for Downloads: `cd Downloads/`
- Then make the file executable: `chmod +x Helper.sh`
- Then execute it: `sudo ./Helper.sh`

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you get a question about adding the "Garuda Build" key, press **no** because while system upgrade it will fail completely and you need to manually install the CachyOS repos (again).

### **Infos:**

- Make sure that the pre-release script can break things because it's still in development and, because of that, it makes the script very unstable.
- The script does not install a desktop environment for you.
